## Features

<!-- List the features of your application or follow the template. Don't share the figma file here :) -->

This app, which I created as a submission to the [DevChallenges](https://devchallenges.io/challenges) challenge, was my contribution to the challenge titled [Recipe-page](https://devchallenges.io/challenges/OEKdUZ6xs0h99C38XVht). The main goal of this project was to build a web application that would meet specific user stories.

The application revolves around a recipe to make a cake. I developed it using a combination of HTML, CSS, and React to create a visually appealing and interactive web page.

In the process of building the app, I made extensive use of flex properties to ensure that the page components are arranged in a responsive manner. This allows the page to gracefully adapt to different devices and screen sizes. Additionally, I used various size properties to control the layout and formatting of different paragraphs, improving the overall presentation of the recipe.
